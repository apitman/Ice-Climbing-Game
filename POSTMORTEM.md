# Postmortem

All in all, I'm surprised I was able to get this far after only 6 hours of real working time as a Unity beginner working solo. I've got a lot of other time commitments that meant I wasn't able to do more work than that in this 48 hour period.

Takeaways

* I need to do more Unity development than once every year or two so that I don't have to re-learn all the basics all over again. It took me a long time just to figure out how to create basic objects and assign colors/materials to them so they looked different, not to mention figuring out how to get basic collision triggers working.
* Using the very basic Unity shapes and not putting any time into "developer art" saved me a lot of time and is something I should continue to do since I'm not an artist and don't have the time to learn how for the occasional game jam.
* I should set up my environment ahead of time so that I've got an empty Git repo and an empty Unity project ready to go before the jam even starts. I had to download the latest version of Unity and set up my environment during my very limited jam time.
* I should publish early and often to itch.io and make sure I am familiar with Butler and how to publish to itch.io before the jam starts. I knew this would be a problem this time and yet I still needed to use the grace period after the jam was over to publish and submit my entry to the jam because I only started trying to publish it 15 minutes before the unofficial end of the jam.
* I did a good job of cutting my scope down more and more so that I ended up with something I will call "technically a game" (since it has user controls, a win state, and a lose state)
* It is still a little disappointing that I didn't get to implement more of my idea, with the option to cut the rope on your buddy if you weren't going to be able to save them, and a mini-game for when your buddy falls and needs you to help them recover.
* I need to be careful to set up the positioning of my objects correctly from the beginning next time. I did it backwards and so the x-axis is flipped here, causing a minor math complication in a few places and some UI text trickiness.
